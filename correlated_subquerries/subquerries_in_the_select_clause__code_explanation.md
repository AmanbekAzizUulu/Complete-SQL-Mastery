Both queries aim to retrieve client information along with their total sales, the average sales, and the difference from the average. However, they have different approaches and issues. Hereâ€™s a comparison between Query #1 and Query #2:

### Query #1

```sql
SET @average = (
    SELECT
        AVG(invoice_total)
    FROM
        invoices
);

SELECT
    client_id,
    first_name,
    (
        SELECT
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM
            invoices AS inv
        WHERE
            cl.client_id = inv.client_id
        GROUP BY
            inv.client_id
    ) AS total_sales,
    ROUND((@average), 2) AS average,
    ROUND(((SELECT total_sales) - @average), 2) AS difference
FROM
    clients AS cl;
```

**Key Points:**
- **Subquery for `total_sales`**: For each `client_id`, a correlated subquery calculates the total sales by summing `invoice_total` from the `invoices` table.
- **`@average`**: The average sales are set as a variable and used to calculate the difference.
- **Issue**: The subquery for `total_sales` might cause performance issues if there are many clients. The `total_sales` is recalculated for each row. Also, the `(SELECT total_sales)` syntax is incorrect because `total_sales` is a column alias within the subquery and cannot be referenced directly.

### Query #2

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT client_id,
    (
        SELECT
            first_name
        FROM
            clients
        WHERE
            client_id = outer_inv.client_id
    ) AS first_name,
    (
        SELECT
            SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM
            invoices
        WHERE
            client_id = outer_inv.client_id
        GROUP BY
            outer_inv.client_id
    ) AS total_sales,
    ROUND((@average), 2) AS average,
    ROUND(((SELECT total_sales) - @average), 2) AS difference
FROM 
    invoices AS outer_inv;
```

**Key Points:**
- **Subquery for `first_name`**: Fetches `first_name` based on `client_id`.
- **Subquery for `total_sales`**: Similar to Query #1, this subquery calculates `total_sales` by summing `invoice_total` for each `client_id`.
- **`DISTINCT` Keyword**: This might not be necessary if you use the `GROUP BY` clause.
- **Issue**: The use of `DISTINCT` with subqueries might be redundant. The reference to `total_sales` in the `ROUND()` function is incorrect since `total_sales` is not directly accessible in this context.

### Summary of Differences:

1. **Approach**:
   - **Query #1**: Uses a subquery to get `total_sales` and joins it with `clients`. The `@average` is used in calculations.
   - **Query #2**: Focuses on invoices and tries to fetch `first_name` and `total_sales` with subqueries.

2. **Variable Usage**:
   - Both queries face issues with how they use and reference the `total_sales` variable in the `difference` calculation.

3. **Performance**:
   - Both queries can be optimized to avoid recalculating `total_sales` multiple times. A better approach would involve joining `clients` and `invoices` and aggregating results efficiently.

### Corrected Approach

To improve efficiency and correctness, you could use the following query:

```sql
USE sql_invoicing;

-- Calculate the average invoice total for all clients
SET @average = (
    SELECT AVG(total_sales)
    FROM (
        SELECT client_id, SUM(invoice_total) AS total_sales
        FROM invoices
        GROUP BY client_id
    ) AS subquery
);

-- Retrieve client details, total sales, average, and difference from the average
SELECT
    cl.client_id,
    cl.first_name,
    COALESCE(SUM(outer_inv.invoice_total), 0) AS total_sales,
    ROUND(@average, 2) AS average,
    ROUND(COALESCE(SUM(outer_inv.invoice_total), 0) - @average, 2) AS difference
FROM
    clients AS cl
LEFT JOIN
    invoices AS outer_inv ON cl.client_id = outer_inv.client_id
GROUP BY
    cl.client_id, cl.first_name;
```

This approach uses a `LEFT JOIN` to combine `clients` and `invoices`, calculates total sales, and handles the average and difference calculations efficiently.
