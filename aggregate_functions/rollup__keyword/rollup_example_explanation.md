The two SQL queries you provided give different results due to differences in their `GROUP BY` clauses and the usage of the `ROLLUP` operator. Let's break down each query and explain why they produce different outcomes.

### Query 1

```sql
select
    pms.payment_method_name,
    sum(ps.amount) as total
from
    payments as ps
join
    payment_methods as pms
    on
        ps.payment_method_id = pms.payment_method_id
group by
    pms.payment_method_name,
    ps.amount with rollup;
```

#### Explanation:

- **Selection**: Selects the payment method name and the sum of the payment amounts.
- **Join**: Joins the `payments` table with the `payment_methods` table based on `payment_method_id`.
- **Group By**: Groups the results by `payment_method_name` and `ps.amount`, with `ROLLUP`.
- **ROLLUP**: Adds subtotals and a grand total for each combination of `payment_method_name` and `ps.amount`.

In this query, the `ROLLUP` is applied to the combination of `payment_method_name` and `ps.amount`. This means that it will produce subtotals for each payment amount within each payment method and a grand total for all payment methods and amounts. 

This can result in a large number of rows, especially if there are many distinct `amount` values. The subtotals will be grouped by `payment_method_name` first and then by each `ps.amount`.

### Query 2

```sql
select
    pms.payment_method_name,
    sum(ps.amount) as total
from
    payments as ps
join
    payment_methods pms
    on
        ps.payment_method_id = pms.payment_method_id
group by
    payment_method_name with rollup;
```

#### Explanation:

- **Selection**: Selects the payment method name and the sum of the payment amounts.
- **Join**: Joins the `payments` table with the `payment_methods` table based on `payment_method_id`.
- **Group By**: Groups the results by `payment_method_name`, with `ROLLUP`.

In this query, the `ROLLUP` is applied only to `payment_method_name`. This means it will produce subtotals for each payment method and a grand total for all payment methods, without considering individual payment amounts.

### Key Differences

1. **Grouping Columns**:
    - **Query 1** groups by both `payment_method_name` and `ps.amount`.
    - **Query 2** groups only by `payment_method_name`.

2. **ROLLUP Application**:
    - **Query 1**: `ROLLUP` operates on combinations of `payment_method_name` and `ps.amount`, leading to subtotals for each amount within each payment method.
    - **Query 2**: `ROLLUP` operates on `payment_method_name` alone, leading to subtotals only for each payment method.

3. **Result Set Size**:
    - **Query 1** can produce a larger and more detailed result set due to the finer level of grouping.
    - **Query 2** produces a more summarized result set, with subtotals and grand totals only at the level of payment methods.

### Example Scenario

Assume you have the following data:

| payment_method_name | amount |
|---------------------|--------|
| Credit Card         | 100    |
| Credit Card         | 200    |
| Cash                | 150    |
| Cash                | 150    |

#### Query 1 Results:

| payment_method_name | amount | total |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| Credit Card         | 100    | 100   |
| Credit Card         | 200    | 200   |
| Credit Card         | NULL   | 300   | (Subtotal for Credit Card)
| Cash                | 150    | 300   |
| Cash                | NULL   | 300   | (Subtotal for Cash)
| NULL                | NULL   | 600   | (Grand Total)

#### Query 2 Results:

| payment_method_name | total |
|---------------------|-------|
| Credit Card         | 300   |
| Cash                | 300   |
| NULL                | 600   | (Grand Total)

### Summary

- **Query 1** provides a detailed breakdown including the amounts, leading to more rows with subtotals for each `amount` within each `payment_method_name`.
- **Query 2** provides a summary at the `payment_method_name` level, leading to fewer rows with a single subtotal for each `payment_method_name`.

This explains why the two queries produce different results.

### Understanding `ROLLUP` in SQL

`ROLLUP` is an extension of the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL that adds subtotals and a grand total to the result set. It’s particularly useful for generating reports that require aggregated data at multiple levels of a hierarchy.

### Syntax
The basic syntax for using `ROLLUP` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    column1, 
    column2, 
    ..., 
    aggregate_function(column)
FROM 
    table
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (column1, column2, ...);
```

### How `ROLLUP` Works

`ROLLUP` creates a hierarchy based on the order of columns listed. It performs the following:

1. **Normal Grouping**: Groups by all columns specified.
2. **Subtotals**: Adds subtotals for each level of the hierarchy, except the last one.
3. **Grand Total**: Adds a grand total for the entire result set.

### Example

Consider a sales database with a table `sales` that has columns `region`, `product`, and `sales_amount`.

#### Sample Data

| region | product | sales_amount |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| East   | A       | 100          |
| East   | B       | 150          |
| West   | A       | 200          |
| West   | B       | 250          |

#### Query Using `ROLLUP`

```sql
SELECT 
    region, 
    product, 
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (region, product);
```

#### Result

| region | product | total_sales |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| East   | A       | 100         |
| East   | B       | 150         |
| East   | NULL    | 250         | -- Subtotal for East region
| West   | A       | 200         |
| West   | B       | 250         |
| West   | NULL    | 450         | -- Subtotal for West region
| NULL   | NULL    | 700         | -- Grand Total

### Explanation

1. **Normal Grouping**: The query groups by `region` and `product`, summing the `sales_amount`.
2. **Subtotals**: For each `region`, it calculates a subtotal (represented by `NULL` in the `product` column).
3. **Grand Total**: It calculates the grand total for all regions and products (represented by `NULL` in both `region` and `product` columns).

### Multiple Levels of Hierarchy

You can have multiple levels of hierarchy in your `ROLLUP`. The order of columns in the `ROLLUP` clause determines the hierarchy.

#### Example with More Levels

```sql
SELECT 
    region, 
    product, 
    sales_rep,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    sales
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP (region, product, sales_rep);
```

This will add subtotals for each combination of `region` and `product`, as well as the grand total.

### Handling `NULL` Values

- **Subtotals and Grand Totals**: The `NULL` values in the result set from `ROLLUP` indicate subtotals or grand totals.
- **Distinguishing `NULL` Values**: If your data already contains `NULL` values, you may need to distinguish between `NULL` as a data value and `NULL` as a subtotal/grand total indicator. Using additional logic or labels can help.

### Practical Applications

1. **Financial Reports**: Summarize sales data by product, region, and overall.
2. **Inventory Management**: Aggregate inventory levels by category, subcategory, and total.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Summarize employee performance by department, team, and company-wide.

### Performance Considerations

- **Complexity**: `ROLLUP` adds complexity to the query execution plan. Ensure your database is indexed appropriately.
- **Large Data Sets**: When working with large data sets, test and optimize your queries to handle the additional computations introduced by `ROLLUP`.

### Conclusion

`ROLLUP` is a powerful tool for creating summary reports with multiple levels of aggregation in SQL. By understanding its syntax and behavior, you can efficiently generate comprehensive reports that provide insights at various levels of detail.
